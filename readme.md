# Go interview questions

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/fearful-symmetry/go-interview.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/fearful-symmetry/go-interview)

A collection of common coding interview questions, all written in go

This shouldn't be considered an authoritative collection of best answers, but merely a project to polish my go skills an learn new things.

If you think you have a better solution, or if you think a question should be added, please, submit a PR or file an issue!

If you want to go through the questions without looking at the answers, just use grep:

```bash
~ grep -rn QUESTION . 
```

## Project structure

Right now, this repo is organized by problem "type", starting with arrays.
